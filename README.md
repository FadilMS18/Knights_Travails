# Knights_Travails
Knights Travails project is one project that teach me another data structure that is graphs where one node can traverse to another node that it don't have the pointer to, via it's 'neighbor' that have connection to someone that know that node

## Method
1. addVertex(a) will add given vertex to the graphs
2. addEdge(a, b) will connect 2 given vertex each other
3. printGraphs() will console all of the vertex and its adjacency list
4. MakeTheBoard() will make the board with given possible moves and board size
5. findShortestPath() will console how many steps it takes to traverse from point 'start' to 'end' together with its step by step
